When I first embarked on my journey into the field of sociology, I was driven by a single burning question: Why do some societies thrive and prosper while others, like Serbia, struggle? The answer seemed straightforward: prosperity was linked to the presence of individual freedom. Societies with citizens free to make their own choices tended to flourish, while those burdened by government control and restrictions on personal liberties often suffered. After realizing that sociology wasn't fun anymore, I decided to change my career to something more meaningful. Changing one's career might seem like a daring move, but the beauty of life is that you can always make changes and pursue what you love.
