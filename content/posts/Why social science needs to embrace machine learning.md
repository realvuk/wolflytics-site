Quick note, this is just a first article in a series, something like short intro.

I’m a social scientist and unlike many in my field, I genuinely love math and statistics. My friend Petar likes to joke that statistics isn’t math, but I’ll leave that debate for another time.

What matters is this: social science has long struggled to explain the complexity of human behavior. We rely on methods like surveys, interviews, and content analysis for example. These have their place, but they often fall short when it comes to prediction or uncovering causal relationships. Society is messy. Humans are unpredictable.

And yet I believe we can do better. To do better we need to embrace the power of machine learning (ML).

Machine learning is a branch of computer science focused on training machines to learn from data. In our world, that means building models that can for example extract the groups based on attitudes, predict behaviors, or uncover hidden patterns in huge datasets. Sound familiar? These are the core goals of social science.

In recent weeks, I’ve been working with European Social Survey data (more on that soon), and I’ve seen how ML models like Random Forests or XGBoost can help us answer questions we’ve struggled with for years. What better predicts someone’s trust in police general trust in others, or their occupation? Machine learning can help us figure that out.

We can also turn to Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze text data like public sentiment on social media. What once took weeks of manual coding can now be done in minutes with topic modeling algorithms. Social networks have given us unprecedented access to public opinion. It’s time we actually used that data.

But here’s the challenge: many students enter social science because they think they can avoid math. And I get it our field doesn’t always emphasize technical skills. But if we want to stay relevant, that has to change.

We need to teach coding. We need to embrace data. We need to think beyond averages and p-values.

The world is changing fast. Our methods need to catch up.

So step out of your comfort zone. Learn Python. Play with data. Start small, but start now.

The future of social science depends on it.
